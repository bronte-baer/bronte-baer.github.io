## NLP (Natural Language Processing) & Deep Learning

**Project description:** I explored question generation by creating two transformer-based encoder-decoder models, training and testing those models on multiple datasets, and evaluating their predictions using lexical similarity-focused and semantic similarity-focused evaluation metrics with two colleagues. Our results and analysis are detailed below in our paper.

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
