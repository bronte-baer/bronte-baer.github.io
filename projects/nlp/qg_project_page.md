## NLP (Natural Language Processing) & Deep Learning

**Project description:** I explored question generation by creating two transformer-based encoder-decoder models, training and testing those models on multiple datasets, and evaluating their predictions using lexical similarity-focused and semantic similarity-focused evaluation metrics with two colleagues. Our results and analysis are detailed below in our paper.
